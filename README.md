### Use Java 11 
### Use Spring Boot 2.3.12.RELEASE type version

The reason is some tools and dependencies are not working in higher Java and Spring Boot versions
As example we can consider the Swagger Ui which is only available in the Java 11 and Spring Boot 2.3.12 versions,
so make sure to use the proper version.
